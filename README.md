# The Steroid Era

## INFO 370

## Godwinners: Godwin, Tu, David 

Our general overarching question is to look at the effects the use of steroids and other performance enhancing drugs had on baseball. In order to dive into this analysis, we have chosen four more specific questions to analyze. Two of these questions relate to the performance of players, and the next two relate to the fan base.
  1. How much did the Steroid Era impact offensive production, defined by home runs and RBIs (runners batted in)?
  2. How much did the Steroid Era impact pitching production, defined by fastball velocity and stamina of pitchers (measured by pitch count)?
  3. How does crowd attendance across different stadiums compare to before, during and after the Steroid Era?
  4. How does league revenue/team revenue compare across those same three times?
